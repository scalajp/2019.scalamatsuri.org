When implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD), one of the most important points is to distinguish entities from value objects. However, given that Scala already encourages immutable objects, what's the point of thinking about value objects? Also, how should we persist value objects without unique identifiers?

In this session, I would like to discuss this topic using Eric Evans's 'Domain-Driven Design' and Martin Fowler's 'Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture' as references, while also looking at actual Scala code examples.
