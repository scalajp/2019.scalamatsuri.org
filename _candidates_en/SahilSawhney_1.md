suggestions:
  - 1. People who want to see what all challenges simple, decentralized monitoring brings wrt distributed systems.
  - 2. People who want to understand how monitoring could be done in a reactive way and what all challenges it solves.
  - 3. People who want to get a fair idea about basic building blocks of a successful reactive monitoring pipeline.
  - 4. People who want an efficient mechanism to monitor their applications running over distributed platforms.
  - 5. People who want to understand how applying machine learning to the accumulated metrics could proactively communicate a future failure.

It is critical to monitor your reactive ecosystem consisting of technologies like Scala, Akka-Http, Lagom, Cassandra, Kafka etc and plain vanilla monitoring is just not enough to ensure your reactive system is well covered. An approach, PreMonR (premonition based reactive ecosystem monitoring), was thus fabricated to ensure that the monitoring pipeline must itself be reactive and injected with premonition based anomaly detection which could aid in much advance detection of any threats to the smooth functioning of the reactive system especially running on distributed systems like Kubernetes.
