A lot of the software products today consist of components that need to run on mobile devices. Although there are many frameworks allowing for the development of aps for Android and IOS, most of them use technologies that are far away from Scala. This talk is a about a group of die - hard Scala enthusiast who were determined to bring their favourite language from the server room to the mobile phones of people.
