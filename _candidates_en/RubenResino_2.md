I’m worked for a lot of time using Java and Object Oriented Programming, but I felt that something was wrong, something was not working well in all of my projects…

But Morpheus showed me the real world, It’s Scala and Functional Programming and how it can change the world. You have to choose the red pill but It a risky path to discover the amazing world about monads, type classes, referential transparency, recursion …

If you feel uncomfortable with Java or another OOP language or you want to discover the real world choose the red pill.
