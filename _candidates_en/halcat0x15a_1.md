Do you understand logic programming such as Prolog? If so, do you know that you can express logic programming using MonadPlus? Do you want to try programming with backtracking or unification using Scala?

In this session, I will introduce logic programming using Scala and implementation of Logic monad using Freer (or Extensible Effects).
