GraalVM is a universal virtual machine for running applications written in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, JVM-based languages like Java, Scala, Kotlin, Clojure, and LLVM-based languages such as C and C++. GraalVM removes the isolation between programming languages and enables interoperability in a shared runtime. It can run either standalone or in the context of OpenJDK, Node.js, Oracle Database, or MySQL.

With GraalVM the Scala compiler is more than 1.3x faster. Improve compilation speed by running scalac with GraalVM.

For Scala programs using open-source version of Graal will give about 8% of performance improvement on average.

- GraalVM Advanced optimisations
- GraalVM runs Scala programs natively on different target platforms with better performance than the JVM.

Can we write a Scala program that runs on all mobile (e.g. IOS and Android) and embedded platforms?

Can we use Scala to develop cross-platform user interfaces without writing platform-specific code?
