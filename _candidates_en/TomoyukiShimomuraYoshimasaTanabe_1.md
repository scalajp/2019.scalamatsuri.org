When you are developing in a team, have you ever found the requirements to be vague, or felt that something was not right about the domain model? We often hear about projects where the modeling and design are done based on some individual's sense or skills. It's not hard to imagine where that road could lead - a spiral of harmful effects such as increasing costs to add new features and technical debts.

In this session, we would like to introduce a formal approach to requirements capturing, domain modeling, and detail designs without relying on intuition. We've written the output from each phase using Scala, and would like to discuss the overall benefits of using Scala in this approach. Our overarching goal is to capture the business requirements and continuously provide quality software in a consistent manner as a team.
