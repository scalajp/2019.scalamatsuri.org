Keeping the functional paradigm intact while using complicated monad structure in your code could be quite a tedious task. Especially, when your business logic needs to be structured in a flow. Well, definitely Monads composition is the savior in this kind of situations, however, composing them practically is again a cumbersome task. We will be jumping into some coding examples in this talk, which would hopefully make you sit back and relax when you face this kind of situation again. We would create custom monads, usage of monadic operator and monads transformation.
