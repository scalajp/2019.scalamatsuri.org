Logging is an inevitable element in application. Without logs, we won't be able to investigate an error. Without logs, we won't know how many requests your application was able to handle. When we overlook logs, we, the engineers get hurt.

In this session, I will discuss how logs should be, how to use Java and Scala logging libraries such as slf4j, and describe my own improvements in logging practices.
