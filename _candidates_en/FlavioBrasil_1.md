The #TwitterVMTeam is investing in optimizing the JVM to improve the performance of Scala applications. We've migrated to Graal as the JIT compiler and observed a significant performance improvement. The migration also opened the path to implementing optimizations since its codebase is in Java and more manageable.

This talk will present a few performance challenges of our Scala applications and how the #TwitterVMTeam has been working to address them. It'll cover optimizations for more efficient Future execution and new approaches to deal with the overhead of invokeinterface calls.
