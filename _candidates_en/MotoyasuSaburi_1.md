Have you ever wondered about the vulnerabilities in your web frameworks?

If you are a web application developer, you might be familar with the causes and impacts of well-known security vulnerabilities. However, few people would dig into the vulnerabilities and root causes within the web framework.

In this session, we will go over both impacts and the root causes of vulnerabilities by looking into the security updates of Play Framework. (Note: This will be limited to reasoning based on the code changes, without proof-of-concept testing.)
