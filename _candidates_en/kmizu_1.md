The Dependent Object Types (DOT) calculus is the theory on which Dotty (which will be Scala 3.0) is based. The DOT calculus is a model to understand the theoretical backbone of Scala. Such a model is called a "core calculus", and it is used to prove the characteristics of a programming language. In this session, I'll give a gentle introduction to the DOT calculus.
