Everyone says "Scala and Kotlin are similar", but is that actually true? There are indeed syntactical similarities, but there are many fundamental differences. Based on my experience using both Scala and Kotlin extensively at work, I would like to discuss how different these two languages are through the use of code examples.

This is also an opportunity to discuss some of the strange commonalities between these two distinct languages that are syntactically similar. We will also cover the functional programming libraries (Scala, Cats, Arrow) from both languages.
