In this talk I will derive the core ideas behind recursion
schemes and finally tagless encoding starting from scratch.
We will start with a short introduction to type algebra and
isomorphisms. Then we will take simple recursive data types
and explore various `fold`-like operations on them and how we 
can massage them into different forms using isomorphisms: final 
tagless, recursion schemes, `foldMap`-like operations, and direct 
`foldr`-style. We will naturally arrive at the `Recursive` typeclass, 
Boehm-Berarducci encoding of ADTs, catamorphisms and F-algebras.
