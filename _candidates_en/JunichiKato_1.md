There's a growing movement of building fault-tolerant and scalable systems by constructing Akka Clusters on top of Kubernetes. Akka is a toolkit to develop distributed applications across multiple nodes, so it needs to be supplemented with container-level orchestration for deployment and scaling. In that sense, Kubernetes is actually becoming a practical option. There will be increased interest in Japan, as Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) has just arrived to the Tokyo region.

In this session, we will discuss how to implement a robust Event Sourcing on EKS and discuss some of the issues we might face while looking at running code.
