The transactions of online advertisement, sometimes described with a "chaos map", is a complex domain involving various players. CyberAgent has built ad distribution systems many times, but we have recently adopted Domain Driven Design (DDD) for the first time.

In this case study, I would like to share the architecture of the system we build, the reality of domain modeling, what we prioritized, and what we compromised using the actual domain models and code.
