We’ve all heard about Dotty or Scala 3 either through Martin Odersky’s great talks or features listing on Dotty’s website. This sounds like a big change but how will it affect me as a Scala user in my day to day development?

Here at Netflix we are processing millions of events per second with Scala, so we’ve hit a few corner cases of the language that often end up in complicated and boilerplate workarounds that new features in Scala 3 are believed to be solving.

Please join this talk to see what the future of the Scala landscape looks like for you and discuss your own compilation stories.
