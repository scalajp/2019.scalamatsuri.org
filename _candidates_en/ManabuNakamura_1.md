Information system are solving more and more complex problems.
To solve complex problems, you need to devide and conquer approach, which devlide problem first then compose solutions.
In this session, I will talk about two approaches "Continuation-passing style" and "DI"  as compose reusable modules. I will also discuss tools for devide and conquer while comparing them.
