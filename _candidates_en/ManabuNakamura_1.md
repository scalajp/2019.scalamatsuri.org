Information system are solving more and more complex problems.
To solve complex problems, you need to utilize the divide and conquer approach, which divides the problem first then composes solutions.
In this session, I will talk about two approaches, "Continuation-passing style" and "DI", for composing reusable modules. I will also discuss tools for dividing and conquering while comparing these approaches.
