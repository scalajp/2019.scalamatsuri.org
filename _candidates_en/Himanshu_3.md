Every publication has a rich set of documents that contain information about different domains. If used wisely, they can prove to be a golden set for companies operating in domains like pharma, medical, or financial institutions.
For example, today it takes any pharmaceutical company up to 12 years and $2 billion to bring a single new drug to market. This talk explains how we can apply Spark ML to tag 100s of thousands of documents. Applying ML will not only make tagging process faster & less expensive but also can explore new fields which are overlooked by SMEs.
