We have released a payment transaction service adopting Akka Cluster. In this case study, I would like to discuss lessons learned from developing with Akka Cluster. I will describe how we migrated from a traditional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) -based system using a relational database to a model using actor model and Event Sourcing / CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) based on this project.
