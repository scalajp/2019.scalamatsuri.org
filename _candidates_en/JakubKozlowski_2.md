If you're going to write a modern web service, you have a wide range of frameworks and libraries to choose from. One of them is http4s, a functional library for writing HTTP services and clients in Scala. I'm going to show you why you should consider it for your next application, for reasons including but not limited to:
- type-safe request/response models that are uniform between client and server
- resource-safe servers, response/request bodies, and streaming
- framework-agnostic testing.
