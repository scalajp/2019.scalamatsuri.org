<h1>Code of conduct</h1>
<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>
ScalaMatsuri is dedicated to providing an open conference for all technologists from various regions and communities. We want to make it a fun experience for everyone, inclusive of gender, race, and many different backgrounds whom they may not meet in their daily life.
</p>
<p>
The following Code of conduct is a guideline to prevent all of us from making inconsiderate behavior, intentional or otherwise. The ScalaMaturi comittee requires all participants, including speakers and sponsors to comply with the Code of conduct as part of our active step to prevent inappropriate behaviors.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Body</h2>
<p>
All communication is expected to be appropriate for a technology conference with professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. ScalaMatsuri does not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
</p>
<p>
We expect all participants, including guests, exhibitors, sponsors, booth staff, and the organizers, to follow these rules at all conference venues, conference-related social events and communications in SNS. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior (regardless of the intention) are expected to comply immediately.
</p>

<p>
  Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
  <ul>
    <li>Asking other participants out (comments about appearance, romatic or sextual interest) or inappropriate physical contact.</li>
    <li>Offensive verbal comments or discriminatory behaviors related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, nationality, ethnicity, or religion.</li>
    <li>Sexual images in public spaces.</li>
    <li>Deliberate intimidation; stalking, following, harassing photography or recording.</li>
    <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events.</li>
    <li>Use of sexualized images, activities, or other material during the session.</li>
    <li>Use of sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes by the booth staff or volunteers, or otherwise creating sexualized environment in the booth or the displayed material.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take actions like giving a citation or a warning. If the harassing behavior does not stop regardless of the warning and recognized as unruly incident, the conference organizers may expulse from the conference with no refund. All participants, including guests, exhibitors, sponsors, booth staff, must comply to the order by the conference organizers immediately without condition.
</p>
<p>
  The code of conduct is subject to change without notice.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  Similar code of conduct have been adopted by PNW Scala, NE Scala, and Scala Days to provide a harassment-free conference. We also support the cause.
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>The following descibes the operational process by the conference organizers. It is subject to change without notice.</p>
<ul>
<li>The conference organizers are to prepare an incident reporting form both in offline and online. Upon a report, adequate actions will be taken like giving a citation or a warning to prevent from repeating the incident.</li>
<li>All sponsors are asked to comply with the Code of conduct when they apply. Their slides and commercial videos are checked beforehand and modified if necessary.</li>
<li>All speakers are asked to comply with the Code of conduct when they apply to CFP. Their slides are checked beforehand and modified if necessary.</li>
<li>In Unconference, the conference organizers will ask speakers to be checked to comply with Code of conduct before their talks. Due the nature of Unconference, it will be difficult to guarantee prior check of all contents, so this will require cooperation from all participants.</li>
</ul>
