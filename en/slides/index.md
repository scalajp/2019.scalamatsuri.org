# Subtitles on your presentation deck

We want to make it a fun event for both the Japanese audience and those visiting Japan from overseas.
Please leave a room on the bottom of each slide so we can put subtitles in your sides. The ScalaMatsuri staff will provide the translation.

# How to put "subtitles"

- [Building a Unified Data Pipline in Spark](http://www.slideshare.net/scalaconfjp/building-a-unified-data-pipline-in-spark)
- [The Evolution of Scala](http://www.slideshare.net/scalaconfjp/the-evolution-of-scala-scala)
- [Sample Deck (Keynote 09)](/img/sub-samples/sub-sample.key)
- [Sample Deck (PDF)](/img/sub-samples/sub-sample.pdf)
- [Sample Deck (PowerPoint)](/img/sub-samples/sub-sample.pptx)

Like the above sample decks, please create a black text box to fit **2 lines** in **36px font** (27pt on Windows, 36pt on Mac) at the bottom each slides.

## Submit your slides

Please submit your slide decks by February 18th to cfp2018@scalamatsuri.org .

ScalaMatsuri staff will provide the translation, and also check for Code of Conduct compliance.
Since the translation will be done based on text, if you could please submit a text file with all the texts along with your slide deck, it would be most appreciated (like a lot)!
The slide deck will also be submitted to the interpreters.
If you send it as PowerPoint, Google slide show, or Keynote format, we put/fix "subtitles" directly. Otherwise, we send you a translated/fixed text file, so you put/fix by yourself.
We recommend 4:3 aspect ratio, but also 16:9 OK.

If you have any changes by then, feel free to submit the new deck along with the change description such as "changed the text on page 3." Any changes after February 10th will be at your own risk.
